## About Me!

Hello!! Bethany Heard here!!

**Student Number:** s3725671	

**Email:** s3725671@student.rmit.edu.au OR bethheard5@outlook.com 

So, I’m a 19-year-old female who’s primarily lived in very rural and isolated areas my entire life, currently situated in a not-so-rural Geelong. The only language I know fluently is English as my schools didn’t tend to teach many other languages, apart from Indonesian which I have forgotten most of (Although I am interested in learning auslan). I graduated high school in 2018 and originally went to university to study a course in psychology with honors; however halfway through the year I had severely lost interest and dropped out. Now here I am doing IT!

Interesting fact about myself!! I have had both an ‘innie’ and ‘outie’ bellybutton in my lifetime due to a surgery done when I was 7, where my 'outie' bellybutton was made into an ‘innie’ as an unforeseen result of the surgery. How many people can say that?

## Interest In IT
### So, what sparked your interest in IT?

My interest in IT didn’t really start until about the age of 15. It started in a year 9 compulsory IT class, where we were creating a game using the software ‘GameMaker’. What originally appealed me to this aspect of IT was the ability for me to be creative. I was never one to be good at writing or drawing or any of that so this allowed me to channel some creativity. During this lesson my teacher mentioned that they were organizing a coding class for every Tuesday at lunch. I however, chose to not take part, as I felt like I would be made fun of for being a girl interested in coding. I then started to get back into IT when I was about 17 when I started to create fake viruses to put on my brother’s computer that would shut down his computer whenever he clicked on a certain file because I was THAT sibling. This was the beginning of my interest in the security side of IT. Over the last year or so I have been able to learn a little bit of HTML just as a foundation of coding, but other than that I have no real experience with IT.

### Fascinating! But why RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT because it was one of the few options through Open Universities Australian that allowed me study online. I have a very busy life. I work a lot as well constantly trying to spend time with friends and family, meaning that my schedule for studying is very restricted to specific times. I’m very lucky to be able to study IT online through RMIT, and to not feel as though I’m missing out on anything because everything is available to me and scheduled nicely for when I’m available.

### What are you expecting to learn from your studies?

During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a myriad of things about IT. Whether that be the industry itself, and how its advanced/advancing, learning how to program and code to create endless possibilities, and of course to explore the security side of IT I’ve been so interested in, with how the security systems are built and the ways that these systems are programmed to detect threats and also how to get rid of these threats. I expect to learn all and more about all the things I wanted to know as 15-year-old me who didn’t want people to know she was into IT.
