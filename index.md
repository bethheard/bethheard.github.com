## About Me!

Hello!! Bethany Heard here!!

**Student Number:** s3725671	

**Email:** s3725671@student.rmit.edu.au OR bethheard5@outlook.com 

So, I’m a 19-year-old female who’s primarily lived in very rural and isolated areas my entire life, currently situated in a not-so-rural Geelong. The only language I know fluently is English as my schools didn’t tend to teach many other languages, apart from Indonesian which I have forgotten most of (Although I am interested in learning auslan). I graduated high school in 2018 and originally went to university to study a course in psychology with honors; however halfway through the year I had severely lost interest and dropped out. Now here I am doing IT!

Interesting fact about myself!! I have had both an ‘innie’ and ‘outie’ bellybutton in my lifetime due to a surgery done when I was 7, where my 'outie' bellybutton was made into an ‘innie’ as an unforeseen result of the surgery. How many people can say that?

## Interest In IT
### So, what sparked your interest in IT?

My interest in IT didn’t really start until about the age of 15. It started in a year 9 compulsory IT class, where we were creating a game using the software ‘GameMaker’. What originally appealed me to this aspect of IT was the ability for me to be creative. I was never one to be good at writing or drawing or any of that so this allowed me to channel some creativity. During this lesson my teacher mentioned that they were organizing a coding class for every Tuesday at lunch. I however, chose to not take part, as I felt like I would be made fun of for being a girl interested in coding. I then started to get back into IT when I was about 17 when I started to create fake viruses to put on my brother’s computer that would shut down his computer whenever he clicked on a certain file because I was THAT sibling. This was the beginning of my interest in the security side of IT. Over the last year or so I have been able to learn a little bit of HTML just as a foundation of coding, but other than that I have no real experience with IT.

### Fascinating! But why RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT because it was one of the few options through Open Universities Australian that allowed me study online. I have a very busy life. I work a lot as well constantly trying to spend time with friends and family, meaning that my schedule for studying is very restricted to specific times. I’m very lucky to be able to study IT online through RMIT, and to not feel as though I’m missing out on anything because everything is available to me and scheduled nicely for when I’m available.

### What are you expecting to learn from your studies?

During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a myriad of things about IT. Whether that be the industry itself, and how its advanced/advancing, learning how to program and code to create endless possibilities, and of course to explore the security side of IT I’ve been so interested in, with how the security systems are built and the ways that these systems are programmed to detect threats and also how to get rid of these threats. I expect to learn all and more about all the things I wanted to know as 15-year-old me who didn’t want people to know she was into IT.

## Ideal Job

This position of being a cyber security analyst includes testing, using and reporting on cyber security systems. It includes testing the system to pinpoint any vulnerabilities, and to then manage and monitor the remedy of these vulnerabilities. You need to also report to the stakeholders of the company about any issues so that they can be adequately prepared in case of a cyber incident that could be damaging to their company. This position is appealing to me because I love the idea of being able to find and help fix issues within these systems. It is very important that systems like these are performing as well as they can be and are effective. It can sometimes be the difference between a successful company, and a company that falls apart.

In order to be successful in obtaining this position it is highly desirable that you have an undergraduate degree in either cyber security or an IT degree of another relevant discipline. It is also important to have good communication skills, both written and verbal to ensure the issues across as clear as possible. Having work experience that involves providing advice about security risk issues and management to stakeholders is also highly desirable.

In terms of how my skills, experience and qualifications line up with the requirements for this position, I do consider myself to have pretty good verbal and written communication skills, however, I don’t currently have any qualifications or experience in any relevant discipline of IT for this position. That’s a work in progress 😊

To obtain the qualifications and experience needed for this position, my first step is to complete a bachelor’s degree in IT and to specifically focus on the security side later in the degree. Hopefully through this degree I will also be able to pick up some work experience which will also assist in having the qualification I need to succeed in such a position. If I can’t focus on the security side of IT through the later years of my degree, I will try to obtain a postgraduate degree that’s highly specialized for cyber security.

### But what does this all mean??

My Myers-Briggs personality type “The mediator” means that I am a very poetic and kind-hearted individual. It means I carry a high level of altruism and a vivid imagination that make is easier for me overcome challenging obstacles in my life. However, it also means that my altruism can possibly become more of a liability than it does a good thing. As for my learning style, I am an auditory learner. This means I learn things easier by hearing and listening about them rather than reading or watching. This means I tend to learn easier by listening to podcasts or informative videos. I also benefit from reading my work out loud. My big five personality traits show me that while I have the ability to think in abstract and complex ways, and have a tendency to be very cooperative with people, I also have a habit of getting a little bit side tracked  and also tend to be more of a negative and anxious person. I also display a high level of introversion which means I am more withdrawn than most people.

### Oh ok I get it...but how does that effect your behaviour in teams?

These traits have both positive and negative impacts in terms of my behaviour in teams. My vivid imagination can bring new ideas to a team that maybe other people hadn’t thought of, and my ability to think in abstract and complex ways will also be really helpful in terms of putting forward ideas or making things fun and interesting. It also helps that I tend to be very cooperative with other people so I work well in teams, and that with an auditory learning style I’m hyper focused on listening, which especially helps when learning things from other members in the team during a voice call or in person. However, as I do tend to get a little bit side-tracked it’s possible that I may accidentally side-track everyone else or lose track of where I’m supposed to be and fall behind. As an introverted individual, if I do fall behind or am confused, I am less likely to ask for help. It is also possible that my negativity could bring everyone else in the team down.

### Cool! How do you go about forming this team then?

When forming a team, I do need to take these traits into account in order to create the best team possible. As I have a habit of getting side-tracked and tend to be more of a cooperative person than a leader, finding someone with a more dominant personality traits to take a bit more charge and to help keep everyone on track would be a vital part of a team that I am in. It would also be helpful to have members with similar learning styles as we will be able to find resources for each other that we can all easily learn from. Having other members who are also able t think in abstract and complex ways would help with explaining and understanding ideas as well.
