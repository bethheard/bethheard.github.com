# About Me!

Hello!! Bethany Heard here!!

**Student Number:** s3725671	

**Email:** s3725671@student.rmit.edu.au *OR* bethheard5@outlook.com 

So, I‚Äôm a 19-year-old female who‚Äôs primarily lived in very rural and isolated areas my entire life, currently situated in a not-so-rural Geelong. The only language I know fluently is English as my schools didn‚Äôt tend to teach many other languages, apart from Indonesian which I have forgotten most of (Although I am interested in learning auslan). I graduated high school in 2018 and originally went to university to study a course in psychology with honors; however halfway through the year I had severely lost interest and dropped out. Now here I am doing IT!

Interesting fact about myself!! I have had both an ‚Äòinnie‚Äô and ‚Äòoutie‚Äô bellybutton in my lifetime due to a surgery done when I was 7, where my 'outie' bellybutton was made into an ‚Äòinnie‚Äô as an unforeseen result of the surgery. How many people can say that?

# Interest In IT
## So, what sparked your interest in IT?

My interest in IT didn‚Äôt really start until about the age of 15. It started in a year 9 compulsory IT class, where we were creating a game using the software ‚ÄòGameMaker‚Äô. What originally appealed me to this aspect of IT was the ability for me to be creative. I was never one to be good at writing or drawing or any of that so this allowed me to channel some creativity. During this lesson my teacher mentioned that they were organizing a coding class for every Tuesday at lunch. I however, chose to not take part, as I felt like I would be made fun of for being a girl interested in coding. I then started to get back into IT when I was about 17 when I started to create fake viruses to put on my brother‚Äôs computer that would shut down his computer whenever he clicked on a certain file because I was THAT sibling. This was the beginning of my interest in the security side of IT. Over the last year or so I have been able to learn a little bit of HTML just as a foundation of coding, but other than that I have no real experience with IT.

## Fascinating! But why RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT because it was one of the few options through Open Universities Australian that allowed me study online. I have a very busy life. I work a lot as well constantly trying to spend time with friends and family, meaning that my schedule for studying is very restricted to specific times. I‚Äôm very lucky to be able to study IT online through RMIT, and to not feel as though I‚Äôm missing out on anything because everything is available to me and scheduled nicely for when I‚Äôm available.

## What are you expecting to learn from your studies?

During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a myriad of things about IT. Whether that be the industry itself, and how its advanced/advancing, learning how to program and code to create endless possibilities, and of course to explore the security side of IT I‚Äôve been so interested in, with how the security systems are built and the ways that these systems are programmed to detect threats and also how to get rid of these threats. I expect to learn all and more about all the things I wanted to know as 15-year-old me who didn‚Äôt want people to know she was into IT.

# Ideal Job

## Cyber Security Analyst!

![Image of Job description](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62051223/77224272-20670b80-6bb8-11ea-9d85-1430383dfb6e.JPG)

https://www.seek.com.au/job/41171555?type=standard#searchRequestToken=07c50ce5-9a41-4f2b-9a58-d519b349722a

## So what exactly does this job entail?

This position of being a cyber security analyst includes testing, using and reporting on cyber security systems. It includes testing the system to pinpoint any vulnerabilities, and to then manage and monitor the remedy of these vulnerabilities. You need to also report to the stakeholders of the company about any issues so that they can be adequately prepared in case of a cyber incident that could be damaging to their company. This position is appealing to me because I love the idea of being able to find and help fix issues within these systems. It is very important that systems like these are performing as well as they can be and are effective. It can sometimes be the difference between a successful company, and a company that falls apart.

## Sounds like fun! What kind of skills, qualifications and experience do you need for that kind of job?

In order to be successful in obtaining this position it is highly desirable that you have an undergraduate degree in either cyber security or an IT degree of another relevant discipline. It is also important to have good communication skills, both written and verbal to ensure the issues across as clear as possible. Having work experience that involves providing advice about security risk issues and management to stakeholders is also highly desirable.

## Oh wow! Do you have those kinds of qualifications??

In terms of how my skills, experience and qualifications line up with the requirements for this position, I do consider myself to have pretty good verbal and written communication skills, however, I don‚Äôt currently have any qualifications or experience in any relevant discipline of IT for this position. That‚Äôs a work in progress üòä

## Yikes.... so whats the plan Beth?

To obtain the qualifications and experience needed for this position, my first step is to complete a bachelor‚Äôs degree in IT and to specifically focus on the security side later in the degree. Hopefully through this degree I will also be able to pick up some work experience which will also assist in having the qualification I need to succeed in such a position. If I can‚Äôt focus on the security side of IT through the later years of my degree, I will try to obtain a postgraduate degree that‚Äôs highly specialized for cyber security.

**Big Five Personality Traits**

![big five image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62051223/77224343-c0249980-6bb8-11ea-9e0d-7d2cfaab6c1e.JPG)

## But what does this all mean??

My Myers-Briggs personality type ‚ÄúThe mediator‚Äù means that I am a very poetic and kind-hearted individual. It means I carry a high level of altruism and a vivid imagination that make is easier for me overcome challenging obstacles in my life. However, it also means that my altruism can possibly become more of a liability than it does a good thing. As for my learning style, I am an auditory learner. This means I learn things easier by hearing and listening about them rather than reading or watching. This means I tend to learn easier by listening to podcasts or informative videos. I also benefit from reading my work out loud. My big five personality traits show me that while I have the ability to think in abstract and complex ways, and have a tendency to be very cooperative with people, I also have a habit of getting a little bit side tracked  and also tend to be more of a negative and anxious person. I also display a high level of introversion which means I am more withdrawn than most people.

## Oh ok I get it...but how does that effect your behaviour in teams?

These traits have both positive and negative impacts in terms of my behaviour in teams. My vivid imagination can bring new ideas to a team that maybe other people hadn‚Äôt thought of, and my ability to think in abstract and complex ways will also be really helpful in terms of putting forward ideas or making things fun and interesting. It also helps that I tend to be very cooperative with other people so I work well in teams, and that with an auditory learning style I‚Äôm hyper focused on listening, which especially helps when learning things from other members in the team during a voice call or in person. However, as I do tend to get a little bit side-tracked it‚Äôs possible that I may accidentally side-track everyone else or lose track of where I‚Äôm supposed to be and fall behind. As an introverted individual, if I do fall behind or am confused, I am less likely to ask for help. It is also possible that my negativity could bring everyone else in the team down.

## Cool! How do you go about forming this team then?

When forming a team, I do need to take these traits into account in order to create the best team possible. As I have a habit of getting side-tracked and tend to be more of a cooperative person than a leader, finding someone with a more dominant personality to take a bit more charge and to help keep everyone on track would be a vital part of a team that I am in. It would also be helpful to have members with similar learning styles as we will be able to find resources for each other that we can all easily learn from. Having other members who are also able to think in abstract and complex ways would help with explaining and understanding ideas as well.

# Grand Project Idea!!

The idea for this project is to create a mobile application that allows for individuals to edit, share, compare and sync their schedules with other people in an individualized or group setting ‚Äì all on the go. The project will also include a desktop companion application, which will allow you to view and download schedules that you have synced and backed up into cloud software from your mobile phone. That will be the only purpose of the desktop companion.

The idea of this project came from the fact that I, myself, as well as many others I know, value being able to spend time with family and friends, but because of a busy lifestyle with work and/or university, struggle to schedule times to do so. This application is all about being able to compare your schedules with other peoples‚Äô or groups‚Äô schedules in a quick and easy way to see when you‚Äôre both/all available, without the hassle of long text message threads that lead to no plans being made, and with the ability to do so while out and about living your busy life. It is also a useful way for family to know what your up to if you live with them (like me) so they know when you will and won‚Äôt be home.

This application will include many features to allow for the easiest process of creating and sharing a schedule. The application itself will include regular scheduling application features, such as adding events to your calendar with times and any other important information. It will include the ability to set up event reminders as well as a customizable color code system for the different aspects of your life such as work, schooling, errands and social events. For easy creation of schedules this application will allow you to sync up your accounts (such as Facebook, google and school accounts) and will automatically sync events from their built-in calendars into your schedule to reduce the hassle of manually inputting every event. The application will also notify you of any event clashes when you are creating new events. 

As this application includes a schedule sharing feature every event you create will have its own privacy settings. You will be able to edit which events you want to be shared publicly and which events you want private, therefore creating two separate schedules; one for your eyes only, and one that others will see. You can set it so that events set as private still show on your public calendar but are merely titled ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. Other people will not be able to view your schedule immediately after creating it as you will choose when they see it. The application will include the ability to add other people via their phone numbers; in doing so, you can find their schedules through your contact list, and it also creates a two-factor authentication system for your profile. The application will operate through phone numbers but will only require a network connection for chat purposes.

Through this you can create individualized message threads for schedule comparing, as well as the ability to create group chats for larger event planning. Within the chats there will be an option to create a group schedule. This will become especially helpful if a group or pair of people has more than one event planned or in group projects when there is multiple meet up times. Every chat will automatically compare public schedules, and then list which times all individuals are available within a user chosen timeframe. This eliminates the need for manually checking both schedules side by side, as the application will do it for you. As this application is chat based, you will receive push notifications through your mobile device when messages are received. These push notifications will also be used with event reminders. 

All the events created within these groups will be added to your private calendar for manual review on which events will show publicly. To avoid clutter in private schedules you will have the ability to select and deselect which categories you would like to show ‚Äì this will not effect event clashing as the application will still warn you of clashing events even if the event is in a deselected category. 

To finish, you will be able to sync schedules into cloud software that you can access from a desktop companion on your PC should you need to download these schedules for email or printing purposes. This is the only feature of the desktop companion.

Applications like these require specific kind of software and hardware in order to create. The only hardware you will need to create this application is a PC. Software wise there is a couple of things to consider; the actual mobile application and the cloud services. ‚ÄúEljabberd‚Äù is an open source piece of software that will be used to create the chat servers required for the application ‚Äì Popular mobile chat application WhatsAppTM started from Ejabberd. The open source program ‚ÄúApache CloudStack‚Äù will be used to create and manage the cloud services. The mobile application itself will be completely built using java.

With this software, comes different skills that are required. In order to manage the chat server through Ejabberd, a programming language known as ‚ÄòErlang‚Äô needs to be learnt and known. Obviously to create the application itself, knowledge of Java is required. Apache Cloud Stack also uses Java, so Java is a skill that needs to be known for many aspects of the application. Finding the skills for this project will be difficult if embarked on by yourself. However, recruiting people onto a team that know how to use programming languages such as erlang and java, will make the application a much easier project to work on.

If successfully created, this application will assist and improve on individual‚Äôs ability to retain a work-life balance. It will be easier to see when they can meet people or hold certain events as all the hassle of finding available time is done for you. While the application would achieve its purpose through this, its effectiveness is heavily-user dependent, meaning that individuals using the application need to be constantly updating their schedules and if they don‚Äôt, the application can‚Äôt work to its full potential. This application will hopefully improve people‚Äôs overall life quality, organization and reduce stress associated with keeping that work-life balance.
