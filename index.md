# About Me!

Hello!! Bethany Heard here!!

Student Number: s3725671	

Email: s3725671@student.rmit.edu.au OR bethheard5@outlook.com 

So, I’m a 19-year-old female who’s primarily lived in very rural and isolated areas my entire life, currently situated in a not-so-rural Geelong. The only language I know fluently is English as my schools didn’t tend to teach many other languages, apart from Indonesian which I have forgotten most of (Although I am interested in learning auslan). I graduated high school in 2018 and originally went to university to study a course in psychology with honors; however halfway through the year I had severely lost interest and dropped out. Now here I am doing IT!

Interesting fact about myself!! I have had both an ‘innie’ and ‘outie’ bellybutton in my lifetime due to a surgery done when I was 7, where my outie bellybutton was made into an ‘innie’ as an unforeseen result of the surgery. How many people can say that?
